# Prototype

Prototype involves the creation of objects by copying or cloning rather than creating a new one from scratch, using a constructor or a factory method.

Suppose you need multiple objects, whose initialization is expensive. The common approach is to build them separately. But, this, as said, can be time consuming.

Prototype allows you to clone new objects and change the parameters as needed. This brings together efficiency and the flexibility that you may want when needing to create multiple different objects.

Usually, a prototype object is created and cloned as new objects are needed.
