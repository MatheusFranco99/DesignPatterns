# Factory Method

We've seen the abstract factory design pattern. This pattern creates a base class with abstract methods defining methods for the objects that should be created. Each factory class can create their own implementation.

In the Factory method design pattern, we are dealing simply with a method used to create objects in a class.

Another way to look is tht Abstract Factory deals with creating families of related entities while Factory Method is used to create one entity only.
