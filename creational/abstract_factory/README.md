# Abstract Factory Pattern

(Check Simple Factory and Factory Method)

The Abstract Factory pattern provides an interface for creating a family of related or dependent objects. For example, suppose we may run an application on Windows or on MacOS. For each OS, there are different UI interactions, buttons, etc. It's convenient to create factory classes for all UI objects and also for the whole UI entity.
