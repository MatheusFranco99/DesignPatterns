# Bridge

The Bridge design pattern is useful when we need to extend a class into a new dimension. Instead of creating more inheritance, the bridge pattern uses object composition. This is accomplished by extracting one dimension into a separate class.

For example, we can consider the GUI layer of an app an abstraction and the underlying operating system API the implementation.
